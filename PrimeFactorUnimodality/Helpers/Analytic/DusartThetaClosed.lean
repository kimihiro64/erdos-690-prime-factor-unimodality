# Closed explicit theta estimates

Implementation owner: Luna.

This module must prove and export
`PrimeFactorUnimodality.wangCrapis_thetaBounds : HasDusartThetaBounds`
from the repository's sorry-free zero-free-region, Chebyshev, logarithm-envelope,
and compact finite low-endpoint machinery.  It must not import a prepackaged
Dusart theorem or add an assumption-backed provider.

The exact proof obligations and dependency order are recorded in
`LEAN_COMPLETION_HANDOFF.md`.  The finite singleton seed below is closed; it
does not claim to be the global provider.
