# Closed Wang--Crapis analytic package

Implementation owner: Luna.

After the three analytic provider modules elaborate, this module must define
`PrimeFactorUnimodality.wangCrapisPaperInputs : WangCrapisPaperInputs` and prove
`PrimeFactorUnimodality.completeClassification_closed : CompleteClassification`.
The latter is the sole theorem that `Challenge.lean` and `Solution.lean` should
use for their public all-`k` declarations.

The exact proof obligations and final readiness gate are recorded in
`LEAN_COMPLETION_HANDOFF.md`.  This file intentionally contains no provisional
declaration: a `sorry`, axiom, or bodyless constant would hide the live gap.
